This is a project to develop a free adapter that remaps analog inputs to be more faithful to original to N64 ROMs. For use with Nintendo Gamecube controllers (and N64 controllers?) on Wii Virtual Console. With special support for N64 ROM Zelda titles. Affectionately referred to as an "ESS Adapter"


I will update this to look better eventually.
